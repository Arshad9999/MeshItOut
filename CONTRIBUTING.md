## Pull Requests
We welcome your pull requests (PRs).
For minor fixes (e.g., documentation improvements), feel free to submit a PR directly.
If you would like to implement a new feature or a bug, please make sure you (or someone else) has opened an appropriate issue first; in your PR, please mention the issue it addresses.


## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests.
Before submitting an issue, please make sure:

1. You have read [the FAQ section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) of the Github and your question is NOT addressed there.
2. You have done your best to ensure that your issue is NOT a duplicate of one of the previous issues.
3. Your issue is either a bug (unexpected/undesirable behavior) or a feature request.
If it is just a question, please ask it in the Discussion forum.

When submitting an issue, please make sure to use the appropriate template.
