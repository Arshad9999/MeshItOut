Problem Statement Title : <a href="https://kavach.mic.gov.in/kavach2023PS">Mesh Network App Detection</a>

# Problem Statement

---

Design and develop a technological solution for detecting apps like Fire chat that use Mesh Networking to connect users without cell service in a given area. The solution should be man-portable and should be able to scan an area corresponding to a relatable TSP-BTS(Telecommunications Service Provider-Base Transceiver Station).

# Complexity of the Problem

---

Applications for mesh networking can send signals over a range of frequency bands, including unauthorised ones. Due to the possibility that these signals may not adhere to the typical cellular network frequencies, it may be challenging to detect and distinguish them.

Signals are influenced by a variety of environmental elements, including buildings, trees, and other obstacles, in the continuously changing RF environment. As a result, it could be difficult to precisely detect and locate Mesh Networking app signals.

To protect the confidentiality and security of user data, Mesh Networking apps can employ a variety of encryption and security mechanisms. It may be difficult to recognise and decode these signals as a result.

The fact that Mesh Networking apps are intended to function in locations without cell coverage makes it more difficult to identify their signals. This calls for the portable RF scanner to be capable of picking up signals even in places where cellular network coverage is not present.

Require a significant investment of time, resources, and expertise.

# Novelty of the Project:

---

Develop a unique portable RF scanner: A portable RF analyzer that is more precise, efficient, and effective than current options. This may entail adopting new signal processing algorithms, using new hardware components, or optimising the architecture.

Integrate machine learning algorithms: In order to increase the precision of recognising and distinguishing Mesh Networking app signals, we wil incorporate machine learning algorithms into the software application. This may entail creating fresh algorithms, applying deep learning strategies, or putting the algorithms through training on a bigger collection of RF data.

Use blockchain technology for security and privacy: To guarantee the security and anonymity of the Mesh Networking app signals that have been identified, we will consider using blockchain technology. This may entail creating a protocol based on blockchain technology for safely sending and keeping the signals.

Develop a user-friendly interface: A user-friendly UI for the software programme so that non-technical users can easily comprehend and utilise the answer. This may entail incorporating vocal instructions, streamlining the user interface, or using intuitive visuals.

Improve power efficiency: By utilising new battery technologies or streamlining the hardware and software elements, we will increase the power efficacy of the handheld RF scanner. It will be more accessible and practical to use in the field as a result.

# Feasibility:

---

Meeting the demands of government agencies, law enforcement, and security firms interested in monitoring Mesh Networking activity in specific areas.

The potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks.

This system will detect Mesh Networking apps using a man-portable device that can scan an area corresponding to a relatable TSP-BTS.

# Scalability:

---

As the number of users and devices using Mesh Networking technology continues to grow, the demand for a scalable detection system will also increase.

The detection system will be designed with modular and scalable architecture that allows for easy expansion and integration with other security and monitoring systems.

Using advanced machine learning algorithms and big data analytics tools, The detection system should be able to collect and analyze data from multiple sources, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, and provide real-time alerts and notifications to security personnel.

# Usage
